Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) is one of the primitive linear algebra methods ubiquitous among many machine learning applications. This repository covers the popular use cases of SVD:

1. Image compression using svd
2. Removing static background from videos
3. Generating eigenfaces for facial recognition

.. and few more to come

Hence, by now you must have understood that SVD is the Commander-in-Chief of the Dimensionality Reduction principle(obviously along with its army of variants).
